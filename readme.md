# Basic HTTP server implementations for profiling Bun, NodeJS, Golang and Rust

This project contains basic HTTP server implementations using Bun, NodeJS, Golang and Rust langauages to profile performance of the langauages for daily computational workloads.

## Implementation

All four server endpoints implemented using different langauages use the exact same algorithm. Using basic HTTP utilities to implement HTTP server without relying on sophisticated frameworks.

## Usage

This codebase is created to generate profiling information for the [Bun performance comparison](https://bitsfactory.lilanga.me/posts/bun-performance-for-daytoday-workloads) blog post
